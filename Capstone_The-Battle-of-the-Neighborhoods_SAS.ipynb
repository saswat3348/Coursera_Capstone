    "We are comparing similarities between New York and Toronto to determine how well a Italian restaurant, offering Italian restaurant, would fare in Toronto vs New York. The owner wants to expand and wants to choose between the two viable cities. We hypothesize that one natural way to characterize a city is by the ensemble of amenities it offers.\n",

    "We happed mapped localities in Manhattan and Toronto and determined the neighbourhoods based on their most popular venues. In this project we will try to find an optimal location for the Italian restaurant chain. Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening a **Italian restaurant** in **Toronto**, Canada or **Manhattan, NY**. Since there are lots of restaurants in both the cities we will try to detect **locations that are not already crowded with restaurants**. We are also particularly interested in **areas with no Italian restaurants in vicinity**. We would also prefer locations **as close to city center as possible**, assuming that first two conditions are met.\n",

    "We will use our data science powers to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders.\n"

As one of the more heavily trafficked areas in Manhattan, it’s a noteworthy tourist attraction and busy commercial center, located at the southwest corner of Central Park. There are multiple places worth visiting nearby: the Time Warner Center, Jazz at Lincoln Center, the Shops at Columbus Circle, and the newly opened subterranean mall, TurnStyle.

The High Line’s northern entrance is at the rail yards on this neighborhood’s southern tip.

    "Result of all this is 15 zones containing largest number of potential new restaurant locations based on number of and distance to existing venues - both restaurants in general and Italian restaurants particularly. This, of course, does not imply that those zones are actually optimal locations for a new restaurant! Purpose of this analysis was to only provide info on areas close to city centers but not crowded with existing restaurants (particularly Italian) - it is entirely possible that there is a very good reason for small number of restaurants in any of those areas, reasons which would make them unsuitable for a new restaurant regardless of lack of competition in the area. Recommended zones should therefore be considered only as a starting point for more detailed analysis which could eventually result in location which has not only no nearby competition but also other factors taken into account and all other relevant conditions met."

    "Purpose of this project was to identify Toronto and New York areas close to center with low number of restaurants (particularly Italian restaurants) in order to aid stakeholders in narrowing down the search for optimal location for a new Italian restaurant. By calculating restaurant density distribution from Foursquare data we have first identified general boroughs that justify further analysis, and then generated extensive collection of locations which satisfy some basic requirements regarding existing nearby restaurants. Clustering of those locations was then performed in order to create major zones of interest (containing greatest number of potential locations) and addresses of those zone centers were created to be used as starting points for final exploration by stakeholders.\n",

    "Final decission on optimal restaurant location will be made by stakeholders based on specific characteristics of neighborhoods and locations in every recommended zone, taking into consideration additional factors like attractiveness of each location (proximity to park or water), levels of noise / proximity to major roads, real estate availability, prices, social and economic dynamics of every neighborhood etc."
